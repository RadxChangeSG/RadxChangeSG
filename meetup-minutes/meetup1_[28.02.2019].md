## Debrief
2 Mar 2019 (4pm)

### Rachel's thoughts
- explicitly ask for interest for core membership

### Swarnima's thoughts
 - It's been wonderful working with both of you on this.
 - I was (pleasantly) surprised by the size of the group at the meetup, and wonder what we want to do about that.
 - I don't think that we were able to find members for a core team, so it looks like it might be good for us to really give some thought to governance and how to make radxchange more inclusive
     - we should also compile a list of the sign-in credentials etc so that we can share those easily (as and when required)
     - onboarding(?) materials for new signups
 - Concerns regarding groupthink are _real_ and I'm glad there were people commenting on that.
 - emphasis on projects was good, we should keep that going.

### YT's thoughts
- thank you both for a wonderful meetup <3
- I liked the diversity of attendees (age groups, technical vs non-technical backgrounds) and the unexpected directions that our conversations took
- I want to further explore the "Singapore" focus (e.g. property policies, censorship and activism, relationship with govt.)
- re: format of this chapter, I'm thinking:
    - monthly meetups should focus on knowledge-sharing: project updates, workshops and games, i.e. structured and well-designed programs.
    - basically, the chapter should serve as a network of collaborators and resources, not as a coordinator of efforts
    - it could still be interesting to experiment with open organisation methods though

### Insights from feedback forms

- Poor response rate: only 3 people filled them in despite setting aside time during the meeting to input data.
    - We need to come up with more effective ways to keep people engaged/get in touch with them.
    - However, we do have two more people to reach out from the insights from the feedback forms, so that's a start. (The question was: If you can think of anyone else you know who might be interested in a space like RadxChange, let us know, we'd love to get in touch with them. We should continue to include this in our future forms.)

### Actionables
- write and publish write-up
    - need pictures (Swarnima and Rachel have some)
- set up means of communication
    - Telegram group
    - https://forum.radicalxchange.org
    - Github for actual projects
- move blog from Medium to our Github page using Ghost https://github.com/paladini/ghost-on-github-pages
- reach out to non-blockchain people
- (SS) send out follow-up email (link to blog post, too)
- come up with a way to engage people who haven't read the book
    - (SS) medium articlesummarising the book's key ideas
    - blog post establishing what this chapter hopes to do (outlined below)
- ideas for next meetup
    - (YT) presentation of actual blockchain use cases in #DeFi, governance, and self-sovereign identity (see slides at https://notes.akomba.com/p/SJHtWXzI4#)
    - (YT) interesting projects from Hack4Climate?
    - (YT) Andras from akomba.com could present on Project Halo, a self-sovereign data project: interesting for "Data as Labour"
    - (SS) introduction to mechanism design
    - (SS) mesh networks !!


## Blogpost
- adding to the pockets of alternative spaces and communities in Singapore: a shophouse in the historic town centre, a gathering at the level of physical locality
- diverse crowd (~16 strong?), conversations that challenged us to go beyond groupthink and abstractions (more than half the audience had not read Radical Markets!)
    - diverse age groups, ranging from students to Gen X
    - technical and non-technical backgrounds, including, designers, developers, data scientists, a historian, and an astronomer :-)
    - wide-ranging motivations and interests, including healthcare, human-centred design, active citizenry, economics. Interesting that about half of us had not read the Radical Markets book.
- talk + action: we started with a high-level discussion on systems, trends in politics and socioeconomics; in our later discussion, a list of concrete project ideas emerged, in modelling, design, governance, communication, and other ways to facilitate Radical Markets
- an experiment in open organisations: we explored questions about chapter structure and how members can contribute and engage with each other

### The Singaporean context
- RxC originated in North America; our chapter will not import these ideas wholesale, but will inform them with local context, keeping true to its core spirit of experimentation.
- We also need to contend with political realities of Singapore - this chapter recognises its position in a polity that is largely content with the status quo.
- interesting points raised about SG context:
    - land re-acquisition by govt, public housing
    - policies and attitudes toward activism, civic liberties, spaces for "radical exchange"
    - navigating the relationship with large, influential public sector
    - data availability and scarcity

### Chapter governance
Open organisations, DAOs -- look at colony.io, aragon.org

"DAOs can also help bridge the gap between markets and firms. In The Nature of The Firm, Jim Coase poses the following question. Why do we need firms if markets are so good at allocating resources? The short answer is that although markets at extremely effective at coordinating resources around a price, there are transaction costs that make companies more suited for certain economic activities. Cryptonetworks - and DAOs in particular - can provide a middle ground that reduces transaction inefficiencies and still allows for decentralized collaboration."
(from https://blog.aragon.one/the-future-of-organizations/)

### List of project ideas

#### Modelling
- agent-based modelling of COST (Swarnima, Patrick Haller (haller.ws), Amrullah?)
    - Patrick mentioned that some initial toy models of COST Monopoly had led to runaways/winners, despite the Harberger tax.
    - could be interesting to explore how to model actors with perfect vs imperfect information

#### Governance
- design for RxC time token / governance token (Ying Tong, Rachel)
- using colony.io or aragon.org open organisation frameworks for this chapter (Ying Tong)

#### Public discourse
- "quadratic opinions" on SG policies (Wei Jie)
- municipal service "complaint" portals on public ledger (Ying Tong)
- navigating digital identities to ensure representation + no astroturfing (Wei Jie)

#### Facilitating Radical Markets
- scarcity and payment for digital art (Jef/Chemistry, Mycelium, Open Art Consortium)
- coercion-resistant quadratic voting with zkSNARKs (Ying Tong)
- smart contracts for liquidity and licensing in bone marrow donor registries (Ying Tong)

#### Communication
- digital brochure of blockchain use cases (Rachel, Ying Tong)
- more accessible communications and infographics for Radical Markets ideas (Rachel?)

### List of proto-ideas
- better healthcare: mitigating the profit motives of big pharma
- moving beyond charity: more sustainable community initiatives for the poor and elderly
