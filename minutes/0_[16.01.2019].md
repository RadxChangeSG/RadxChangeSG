## Rachel's minutes

### Chapter structure and channels
#### Collaboration channels
- Slack channel that we can join: invitation
- Resource documents: invitation
- Forum: invitation
- Developing forums and templates that everyone can use
- Getting face-to-face meetings with people who can be the core members that participate
- Word-of-mouth, through Twitter and email (multi-channel is important)
- They will set-up a Master meet-up group: Meetup pro subscription with a lot more features, organization of multiple sub-groups to participate in the larger community around the world

#### Guiding principles
- See the conversation as a call to action, to see how these mechanism designs that will have an egalitarian effect but not a command-and-control effect
- Find that balance between not scaring people and also making sure that you cut-across different cohorts and communicating the objective of the meetups
- Focus on creating conversations and engagement around what kinds of experiments look like, how we can move towards an active outcome, "what can we do together so that we can say that we bring this to the local bicycle club to use quadratic voting to establish their priorities with the city"
- Market socialism isn't a new thing: ownership is by commons, but distribution is by the market --> always raises eyebrows, commons-ownership and market-allocated for more egalitarian outcomes, this group is about market mechanisms to allocate public goods in the best way that maximizes public goods

#### Activities
- Experiments and repository of best practices of what outcomes are --> sharing that
- They will be rigorous about meeting notes: they want to lead by example in terms of documentation and transparency 
- "Optimize Monopoly rules to help reflect COST better" for example as a goal
- Documentation of errors and aymptote to the right kind of model

### Size and profile of people in Seattle chapter
- Something that they are struggling with, on the onset it's people who are associated with Glen in Microsoft or people in the blockchain space (concerned with constituencies implicity)
- Profile of blockchain people are valuable for these experiments: especially in terms of taxing people for ownership, currency and monetary systems
- PHD student, activists on the left frustrated by the lack of progress
- There's a lot of self-selection at the beginning, who is aware of these ideas already
- On their radar: they want to include people with more diverse PoVs
- One boundary condition to set on things: make sure people don't achieve the same goals with different means


### Identity
- Democracy Earth: blockchain-based voting
- The value of property moving towards the value of people
- Self-sovereign identity within the radical market framework, people should hold and control their personal and reputational data (digital exhaust ends up being something big corporations profit off). Only shared by consent and transparently.
- Surveillance capitalism
- "Data is labour" is one of the radical market's chapter

## YT's minutes

core principles of the group:
- using market mechanisms to allocate resources in an egalitarian way
- "decentralisation" as opposed to central planning

shared resources:
- slack
- resource documents on google docs
- discourse forum
- meetup group

see radical markets as a call to action more than an ideology
**internal experiments** and a repository of best practices on how to implement things
- document results and best practices
- e.g. quadratic voting
- transparent meeting notes

profile of 'members':
- self-selection of "converted" in the beginning

misc.:
- self-sovereign data

ying tong's comments:
- i think our strategy should be to reach out to existing groups doing similar work
- i'm for DEBATE and DISCUSSION, making use of the fact that this is such a controversial idea


## Debrief
- YT: We have the opportunity to set the tone. Would like to see more debate in the mix.
- Socialism has been associated with centrally-planned economy: so people find this idea very controversial
- "Excited to talk it out" --> having a diversity of views

- Swarnima: What are the goals of radxchange for you
- YT: Excited about setting up a SG chapter, because not heard about anything even close to this being done in Singapore, push people in Singapore to start questioning the instututions and power structures that underlie our economy, political system and lives
- "Get people thinking in SG and get them together"
- Swarnima: SG is not used to this kind of thought, locally not so much of an interets about how public goods are distributed, seen as the responsibility of the government (URA has blockchain solutions) --> great to have the people come up with their own ideas
- Swarnima: have people be inspired

- Kyber: blockchain-devs meetup set up by Loi Luu; there's also Zilliqa
- First meeting at end Feb
- YT proposed sharding as the first topic

### Roles
- YT: building partnerships for people within and without the blockchain space (environmental groups)
- YT is concerned about having resources and expertise --> we don't have Glen himself here to give lectures! Hoping that we can tap on universities from more traditional economics, political studies, philosophy. Crowdsource these materials. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME WITH THEIR OWN BIASES. YT wants to think about building resources and materials.
- Swarnima: doesn't yet know what skills will be needed
- Swarnima: happy to liaise with other chapters, to chart out a path of what we want to accomplish and where that fits with the other chapters ("we don't wanna rehash what the other chapters are doing")
- YT: Swarnima is still very much connected with the Yale-NUS community! We shouldn't overlook that, there would potentially be an appetite for these ideas.
- Objective: having people engage! Not just come to network
- Swarnima: people interested in blockchain in university and not interested in radical markets.
