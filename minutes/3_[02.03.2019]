RxC Meeting 2 at appear.in/radxchangesg

rachel, ying tong, swarnima


internal meeting (4.00pm - 5.00pm)
----------------------------------

### reflecting on the first meetup

 - YT: thinking about governance, maybe using something like Aragorn to manage our internal governance (essentially using existing block)
 - SS: didn't really find a core team, appreciated the diversity of opinion, but we should do a better job of facilitating (some people really dominated discussions)
 - R: didn't really tell them that we were looking for a core team
     - maybe send everyone YT's slides before each subsequent meetup
 - YT: should not be the three of us deciding who should be in the core team (anyone interested in volunteering can join meetings/Telegram)
 - R: to improve on
     - feedback
     - we should propose more structure, people ended up taking control in ways that we did not foresee
 - YT: actually really like the spontaneity, liked how unpredictable it was
     - but maybe this is more suitable for breakout group formats,
     - all-out discussion not necessarily apt for plenary format
 - YT: this links to a larger question on overall format
     - we need to define properly the goal of the general meetup
     - maybe that can be more sharing of knowledge
 - R: maybe to get things moving
     - next meetup: people can raise their hands and volunteer
     - start with one project and let people join in
     - let people build on that
     - stop the vagueness of having people show up and say a lot with no subsequent action
 - YT: what are people's objectives?
     - the three of us are interested in the long term development of growing this as a community
     - whereas the majority of people are probably there for the content
 - R: we've been summarising the book and connecting it to other projects
     - that's valuable in itself
     - first part of the chapter can focus on that
     - maybe we can focus on the knowledge-sharing part
 - how to get good suggestion channels?
     - Telegram? it's good for converrsations, but it was not made for collaborative documents like hackmd
     - Slack? But Slack just has some ethical hiccups. Not ideal. People not in our slack can't see our discussion...
     - Github? But people without tech backgrounds won't be able to be a part of this.
     - Discourse? It's a forum, but is open source, which is nice. But it's not free (100$ a month)
     - be transparent about our ideas, without dictating them.
 - clear lines between what is a radxchange project and an ethereum project
 - there are problems that don't need software
     - most of our projects are 'software'-based, we should definitely keep our midns open to projects that are not so technologically savvy
 - Use Discourse?
     - Let's use the radxchange discourse
     - Telegram for just shortform channels

## next meetup
11 April, 2019
 - not in March because of Hack4Climate + other commitments
 - gives us more time to publicise/reflect/get great content

     - very designed and structured sessions, essentially

    - (YT) interesting projects from Hack4Climate?
    - (YT) Andras from akomba.com could present on Project Halo, a self-sovereign data project: interesting for "Data as Labour"
